# ECE241-Project

This Project was completed for ECE241 at UofT by users dermarkr and helenjw.

Our focus for the ECE241 final project was to implement an “Alligator Jaw Game” using the
DE1-SoC Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The Alligator Jaw Game is a test of the
player’s reaction time, and begins when a player places their hand in the alligator’s jaws. At
random, the alligator’s jaws will rapidly close on the player’s hand. If the player can escape in
time, the game will continue and increment the player’s score. Conversely, when the player’s
hand gets caught, the player loses, and the game is reset.
